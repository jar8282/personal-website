      <h1>Types of Sequestration</h1>
      <h3>Biological Carbon Sequestration</h3>
      <div class="aside">
        <h4>What is a Carbon Sink?</h4>
        <p>
          A carbon sink is <strong>a resevoir (natural or artificial) of carbon dioxide that was
          created by a process with the ability to sequester carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,
          and store it</strong>. Our most important carbon sinks are our forests and oceans [5]. One
          artificial example is the storage of carbon dioxide underground [4]
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Biological sequestration involves <strong>storing “carbon dioxide in vegetation such as
        grasslands or forests, as well as in soils and oceans</strong> [3]”. Our oceans act as a large
        carbon sink - dissolving about 25% of carbon emissions  from human sources. While
        impressive, this alters the pH of the ocean - making it more acidic and hazardous to
        marine life [3].
      </p>
      <p>
        An additional 25% of total emissions are caught by our forests and
        grasslands. Carbon dioxide absorbed through photosynthesis is put back into the
        ground as plants decay, and leaves fall. Grasslands, in particular, are better carbon
        sinks than forests – “unlike trees, grasslands sequester most of their carbon
        underground” [3].
      </p>
      <h3>Geological Carbon Sequestration</h3>
      <p>
        Geological sequestration is where things get interesting scientifically.
      </p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img class="medium" src="assets/img/carbfix_CO2_process.png" alt="porous rock sequestration example">
        <figcaption style="width:23em;">[4] - Climework's storage partner, Carbfix, turns carbon dioxide into stone by dissolving it into water, and injecting it underground - where it "reacts with basalt rock to form solid carbonate minerals via natural processes[4]".</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In extremely long time scales geologically, the biosphere has built up fuel deposits like
        coal and oil deep underground [2]. By creating artificial methods to do this much faster, 
       <strong>we can now store “carbon dioxide in underground geologic formations, or rocks”,
        typically capturing the carbon from industrial sources, and sequestering it into porous
        rocks for the long term</strong> [3]. This is a process known as carbon capture and storage
        (CCS).
      </p>
      <p>
        A newer innovation is direct air capture (DAC), which captures carbon directly
        from the atmosphere rather than an industrial source – but has yet to be scaled up to a
        cost-effective level [3].
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of how we collect the carbon, <strong>geological
        sequestration is a safer solution</strong>. When forests burn down or die naturally, their trees
        release all of the carbon they’ve captured back into the atmosphere – and reforestation
        takes long periods of time and lots of water [4]. For this reason, biomass is a dangerous
        carbon sink. In order to prevent the release of carbon dioxide, “they can be burned in a
        power plant so that the released CO2 is captured and then buried. This process is
        known as BECCS”. However, BECCS requires too much land on the large scale, with
        high use of water and fertilizer [4]. <strong>Underground, carbon dioxide can mineralize in
        geological formations, and stays safely out of the atmosphere for over 10,000 years</strong> [4].
      </p>
      <h3>Using Them Both Together</h3>
      <p>
        All in all, however, <strong>a combination of these carbon sequestration techniques is the
        best solution to this problem</strong>. No one carbon removal technology is going to solve this
        on its own. We are on a good start to this end goal - “global storage capacity increased
        32% from 2020, with 27 fully operational CCS facilities worldwide and 108 more
        facilities in development [4].” 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the DAC side of things, startup companies like
        ClimeWorks[4] are building scaled up direct air capture plants. Just a couple of months
        ago, ClimeWorks announced Mammoth - their largest site yet. Additionally, <strong>with new
        policies all over the world to protect our forests, and even grow them, carbon
        sequestration seems more feasible every year</strong>.
