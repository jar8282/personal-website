      <h1>RIT & Carbon Sequestration</h1>
      <p>
        Besides the <cite>Reporter</cite> occasionally posting op-eds regarding climate change (they
        had an environmental issue in march of this year), RIT as a educational institution
        signed the climate commitment in 2009. <strong>Since 2011, RIT has been taking stock of their
        emissions, and released a climate action plan</strong>, which was updated in 2017 [9].
      </p>
      <p>
        While the climate action plan contains a multitude of goals for different aspects of climate change,
        it is understandably lacking in direct carbon sequestration, instead focusing on carbon
        neutrality
      </p>
      <figure class="left">
        <img class="small" src="assets/img/hierarchy.png" alt="RIT's carbon management hierarchy">
        <figcaption>[7] - RIT's carbon management hierarchy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>Outlined in the action plan is a hierarchy that shows RIT’s priorities in carbon
        management</strong>. The top priority is to avoid creating new carbon emissions, with the
        second being reducing current emissions. Only third is replacing currently used
        high-emmiting systems, with carbon sequestration fourth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Offsetting emissions is last in
        the hierarchy, taking place 5th [7]. (<strong>Throughout the document, this hierarchy is
        seemingly broken</strong> - but abuse of carbon offsets is its own can of worms, not to be
        opened here).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the process of building the climate action plan, RIT created 3 “working
        groups”, focusing on “Energy, Built Environment, and Land Use and Transportation” to
        aid in identifying plausible sequestration strategies – of these, only the land use and
        transportation group found possible strategies [7].
      </p>
      <h3>RIT Defines Sequestration: Trees & Land</h3>
      <p>
        In the glossary of the plan, <strong>RIT defines carbon sequestration as: “the process of
        removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it</strong>. Planting trees is one way
        in which carbon dioxide is commonly sequestered. Trees use carbon dioxide in
        photosynthesis to produce biomass, capturing the carbon dioxide and turning it into a
        solid form [7]”. The land use and transportation group, in turn, follows similarly.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start, however, after building a baseline for RIT’s sequestration, the plan is to
        “develop a carbon offset program [7]”. Rather than directly change their sequestration
        strategies or add new strategies onto campus, <strong>RIT is starting by building up their data
        network on campus emissions</strong>. 
      </p>
      <figure class="right">
        <img class="medium" src="assets/img/soil_map.png" alt="RIT carbon map">
        <figcaption>[7] - Map of carbon content in soil (main RIT campus)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In addition to building carbon maps of campus, RIT is
        doing some tangible research – “some research has been conducted on campus to
        understand the current carbon sequestration and sequestration potential of the soil and
        vegetation on campus”, and The Environmental Science Department researches and
        teaches classes related to sequestration and soil [7].
      </p>
      <p>
        RIT’s main goal regarding
      sequestration is to have a “net increase in carbon sequestration on campus landscapes
      by 40% by 2030 [7]”. Beyond that, however, <strong>RIT’s climate action plan does not outline
      how they will continue to research sequestration on campus beyond land use -
      sequestration that is not permanent.</strong>
