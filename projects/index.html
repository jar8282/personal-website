      <h2>Personal Projects:</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>RPJava (WIP)</h3>
        <p>
          RPJava is a basic text-based dungeon crawler with randomized elements, written using MVC design principles in mind, and as a study of general object-oriented program design. The game will eventually implement a graphical interface: <a href="https://github.com/jar8282/RPJava" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
        <p>
          This static website was my first introduction to HTML and CSS, built during the spring 2022 semester, and updated as needed: <a href="https://github.com/jar8282/personal-website" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

      <h2>Academic Projects:</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Informational Travel Website</h3>
        <p>
          For Web & Mobile II, I created an informational travel <a href="https://people.rit.edu/~jar8282/ISTE240/final-safe/" target="_blank">website</a> with original JavaScript and DHTML components, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, JS, and PHP, with additional database connectivity. It also included the ability to view/add comments and ratings through SQL -- which was removed in this 'safe' display version of the final website.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Basic Star Rating Slider</h3>
        <p>
          Originally an extra feature for my Web & Mobile II final, I built a star rating system which uses an HTML range and dynamically displays the corresponding rating. An example can be viewed <a href="https://jar8282.github.io/Star-Rating-Slider/"  target="_blank">here</a>, or you can check it out directly on the <a href="https://github.com/jar8282/Star-Rating-Slider" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Research Project</h3>
        <p>
          For my research project in Web & Mobile I, I designed and developed a user-friendly and visually appealing <a href="./ISTE-140/index.html" target="_blank">website</a> using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was based on extensive research on my topic of choice, carbon sequestration.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Music DBMS Project</h3>
        <p>
          For Intro to Database Management, I collaborated on a spotify-like database application, using Java and SQL. We imported a music dataset and allowed users to like songs, add songs to a collection, and add friends. We created and analyzed user data such as listenership on the app over time, and most played songs.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Breadth-First-Search Puzzle Solver</h3>
        <p>
          For the CS 2 class, I created a generic BFS puzzle solver, which worked on well known puzzles like the Die Hard water puzzle and the Rush Hour car jam game. For Rush Hour, I implemented a GUI using javaFX, using user input to solve the puzzle with the BFS algorithm providing hints.
