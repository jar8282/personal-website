      <h1>What is Carbon Sequestration?</h1>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>When our future generations look into their history books at the 21st century, they will see an 
        era dominated by environmental turmoil – and how we dealt with these problems. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the setback in emissions due to covid-19, <strong>average atmospheric
        carbon dioxide hit another record high of 414.72 ppm</strong> [1]. For comparison, 
        over the past 2000 years, this number has been staying around 280 ppm [2]. Most of 
        this increase is due to fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas - which release 
        carbon dioxide when burned [1].
      </p> 
      <p>
        As an important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide traps heat in our
        atmosphere. As we add more carbon into the atmosphere, the natural cycle that keeps
        the greenhouse effect in check becomes overwhelmed, and the atmosphere heats up
        [1]. Due to our reliance on burning fossil fuels and a lack of quick alternatives, carbon
        levels are likely to continue their rise – and greater energy needs make this problem
        worse [2].
      </p>
      <h3>A Possible Solution</h3>
      <p>
        So, without being able to halt the emissions of fossil fuels, how can we mitigate
        climate change? One solution is <strong>carbon sequestration - “the process of capturing,
        securing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere”</strong>. By stabilizing carbon dioxide
        in other forms, it can’t affect the atmosphere [3].
      </p>
      <p>
        While this process can occur naturally
        or artificially, there are two main forms: <strong>biological sequestration</strong>, and <strong>geological
        sequestration</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3>But. . . Why Capture Carbon in the First Place?</h3>
      <p>
        By definition, carbon capture don't reduce our emissions. Instead, it eliminates carbon that has already entered out atmosphere [5]. <strong>It isn't meant to be a replacement for reducing our emissions - but it buys us more time</strong> to to make lasting changes by slowing "the rates of sea-level rise, ice menting, extreme weather occurences, and ocean acidification[5]". 
      </p>
      <p>
        But reducing our emissions isn't going to reduce how much carbon we have already put into the atmosphere. Carbon removal allows us remove "historic CO2 released during the industrial revolution, reducing overall levels in our atmosphere [4]", as well as reduce our current output of CO2. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A combination of carbon capture technology as well as "emissions-reductions strategies, like investment in renewables [10]" is the best way for us to move forward in the climate crisis.
