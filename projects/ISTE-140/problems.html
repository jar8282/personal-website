      <h1>Problems with Carbon Sequestration</h1>
      <p>
        Carbon sequestration does not greatly effect our global carbon emissions yet.
        Why? Surprisingly, it all boils down to economics and natural limitations – and a need
        for further research/development.
      </p>
      <h3>Natural Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Firstly, <strong>our carbon sinks are being used up</strong>  - theres only so much carbon our
        oceans and trees can hold [5]. Planting and growing trees can be cheap and relatively
        easy - but comes at the cost of available land and water, and all that work can be
        undone by a forest fire or deforestation [5]. With this in mind, we need to move to
        artificial methods of sequestration - like CSS and DAC.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, both of these technologies use significant amounts of energy - especially DAC. Companies like Climeworks and Carbon Engineering get around this problem by using "a combination of renewable energy and natural gas, depending on conditions [10]". However, <strong>until these kinds of technologies are scaled up to a viable point, especially smaller plants could be emittimg more CO2 than they remove</strong> - depending on how they get energy.
      </p>
      <h3>Economics</h3>
      <p>
        Carbon dioxide isn’t a particularly valuable resource – Eric Williams, a professor
        at our Golisano Institute of Sustainability, had this to say to the Reporter magazine: <strong>“The
        money that you’re going to spend to turn the carbon dioxide gas into something solid is
        going to cost more than what you’re going to get from being able to sell whatever that
        is”</strong> [6].
      </p>
      <p>
        Professor Williams has researched the carbon capture technology used at coal
        plants, and while very effective, they draw up to 20% of energy from the system –
        causing those plants to burn more coal to compensate. Direct air capture has worse
        issues, taking “an astronomical amount of volume, time and energy” [6].
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, <strong>carbon sequestration is an unsustainable industry</strong>; there needs to be
        something worthwhile in the end to make it worth investing into – and turning carbon
        into biofuel, or chemicals like polypropylene or polyethylene – isn’t profitable at scale yet
        [6].
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        There are some solutions, however. The DAC market is not known for its profit -
        <strong>but recently, companies like ClimeWorks are financially stable enough to expand, and
        scale up their technology</strong>. Heavy investment into the industry is one reason – in 2018,
        ClimeWorks received 30 million in funding. In 2020, it received over 100 million [4].
      </p>
      <p>
        This funding allows for expansion, which in turn lowers their average cost to pull carbon from
        the atmosphere. In addition, ClimeWorks ‘sells’ the carbon they remove via carbon
        offsets, where someone buys the offset to compensate for their own emissions [8],
        allowing for some margin of profit in an otherwise unprofitable system.
