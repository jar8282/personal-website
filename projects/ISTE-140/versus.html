      <h1>Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) vs Direct Air Capture (DAC) </h1>
      <h3>Carbon Capture and Storage</h3>
      <p>
        Carbon capture and storage is focused on emission points like factories and
        other industrial devices. <strong>Its main goal is to reduce the carbon emissions of these point
        sources</strong>, and as such, it is a preventative measure rather than proactive like direct air
        capture [4].
      </p>
      <p>
        CCS is a three step process. First, "the CO2 is seperated from other gases produced in industrial processes, such as those at coal and natural gas-fired power generation plants or steel or cement factories [11]". 
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, the resulting carbon dioxide is "compressed and transported via pipelines, road transport or ships to a site for storage [11]". Lastly, it is "injected into rock formations deep underground for permanent storage [11]". 
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than store the carbon, a similar process is CCUS - Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage - which involves re-using carbon (utilizing it) in "industrial processes by converting it into, for example, plastics, concrete, or biofuel [11]". 
      </p>
      <h3>Direct Air Capture (and Storage)</h3>
      <p>
        Direct air capture isn’t stuck to one location, nor does it require an emission
        point - it <strong>takes carbon out of the ambient air using a filter</strong>. ”DACS is carbon negative,
        while fossil CCS achieves carbon neutrality at best [4]”. 
      </p>

        <img class="medium" src="assets/img/climeworks_system.png" alt="example of DACS device">
        <figcaption>[10] - How Climework's direct air capture and removal works</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Companies like Climeworks and Carbon Engineering are on the forefront of this new technology. "Both companies argue [DACS] can play its role, alongside a net-zero industry transition, in both reducing and removing carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere [10]".
      </p>
      <p>
        Their technologies are very similar - both start off with fans drawing in air, but <strong>"Climeworks captures carbon dioxide on the surface of a 'highly selective filter material'</strong> [10]", with the collector raising the temperature and releasing "high-purity, high-concentration CO2 [10]".
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Carbon Engineering, on the other hand, uses a "potassium hydroxide solution to bind with the CO2 molecules drawn in in by the fans [10]"</strong>, going through checmical changes that again results in pure gaseous CO2.
      </p>
      <p>
        For both technologies, the resulting filtered air is released into the atmosphere, and the captured carbon dioxide is either sent to be stored or reused [10], similar to comparable CCS technologies.
      </p>
      <h3>Similarities</h3>
      <p>
        After the carbon is captured,
        the differences are null; the carbon is still captured and sequestered deep underground
        Both CCS and DAC are scalable, and have much more efficient land use compared to
        natural sequestration techniques [4]. <strong>Utilizing both of these technologies in unison, as
        well as natural sequestration, will be imperative for slowing climate change</strong>.
